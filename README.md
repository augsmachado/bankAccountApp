# bankAccountApp
 
Show a menu with options (this menu should be a method):
- Statement: displays the name, account number, balance and how many withdrawals have already been made
- Withdraw: receives the amount to be withdrawn, informs if it can be withdrawn (cannot be negative) and shows the balance
- Deposit: receives the amount to be deposited and shows the new balance
- Go out

This menu appears until the user chooses to exit. The other options are methods that must be part of "Conta.java" (setters and getters). Note that the user can withdraw a maximum of 5 times a day.
